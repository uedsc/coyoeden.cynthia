The MyPage feature allows users to create customized pages with content that you make available for MyPage. In the settings for each content instance in the content management system, there is an option to &quot;Make Available for MyPage&quot;. Items that have this enabled will show up in the Catalog for user content on MyPage. If you want to use the MyPage feature check this box, otherwise un-check it.
