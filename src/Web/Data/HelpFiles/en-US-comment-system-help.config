<p>It is possible to attach a comments section to the bottom of the center column on any CMS page (ie the pages in the menu). Currently you can use IntenseDebate or Disqus. In the future we will also have an internal comment system. Currently IntenseDebate is recommended due to some known issues in Disqus (your mileage may vary).</p>
<p>To use IntenseDebate you need to enter your IntenseDebate Account Id below.</p>
<p>To use Disqus you need to enter your Disqus Site Short Name below.</p>
<p>You can enable comments on any CMS page (ie pages in the menu) from the Page Settings page where you will see a checkbox for "Enable Comments".</p>
