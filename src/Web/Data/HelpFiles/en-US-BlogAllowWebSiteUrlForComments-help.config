<p>Its common to allow those who post comments in your blog to include a link to their own site. However, sometimes you may find that SEO spammers post just in order to place links to their site in an effort to improve the page rank of their own site. You can disable/hide the url so that this is not possible but it is still possible to post a link in the comments. Hiding the url input may discourage it some.</p>
