If you will be the only one entering and editing content for this site, you just need to be in the Admins role 
and you can do anything.
<br /><br />However if you want to delegate content authoring and have some sort of content approval process,
you can easily do that with the built in roles.
<p>
Members of the Content Authors role and Content Publishers role can create any number of pages beneath this
page, which is not visible to normal users of the site. This gives you an area where you can prepare and review 
content before making it publicly available.
</p>
<p>
Admins or Content Administrators or Content Publishers role members can then move the content to
publicy visible areas of the site when the content is ready.

In general, where you see pencil icons, you can click the icons and edit content. Gear icons usually represent settings you can adjust.
Don't be afraid to click these icons. Have a look around in the settings to see what is possible.
