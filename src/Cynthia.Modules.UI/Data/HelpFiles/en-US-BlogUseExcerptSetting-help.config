<p>Each blog post has its own url where the full post is visible. There is also a blog module that lives on a page and this can show a specified number of recent posts according to the &#160;"Entries To Show" setting. In sme case you may prefer to show only an excerpt of the full post in the blog module with a link to the full post. Check this box to enable showing excerpts in the blog module instead of full posts.</p>
